# C-Telnet Like Utility - Computer Networks semester project 

## Overview
The **C-Telnet_Like_Utility** is a command-line tool built in **C** that emulates the functionality of the traditional **Telnet** protocol, enabling users to interact with remote systems over TCP/IP. It provides a lightweight alternative to Telnet clients, designed for connecting, sending commands, and receiving responses from remote servers.

## Features
- **TCP Connections**: Establishes connections to remote servers over TCP/IP.
- **Command Sending**: Send commands to remote servers and receive responses.
- **Text-Based Interface**: Interact through a simple terminal-based interface.
- **Customizable Timeouts**: Configure connection and command execution timeouts.
- **Non-blocking Mode**: Support for asynchronous communication for more responsive interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **C Language**: Core language used for developing the utility.
- **Socket Programming**: TCP/IP socket programming for establishing server connections.
- **Standard Libraries**: Utilizes standard C libraries for input/output, networking, and handling errors.
